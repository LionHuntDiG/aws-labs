###Functions

String Comparisons
Empty String:

-z "$string": True if the length of $string is zero (i.e., the string is empty).
Non-Empty String:

-n "$string": True if the length of $string is non-zero (i.e., the string is not empty).
Equality:

"$string1" = "$string2": True if $string1 is equal to $string2.
"$string1" == "$string2": Similar to =, often used in [[ ... ]] for enhanced pattern matching.
Inequality:

"$string1" != "$string2": True if $string1 is not equal to $string2.
Pattern Matching (extended test with [[ ... ]]):

[[ "$string" =~ pattern ]]: True if $string matches the specified pattern.
Numeric Comparisons
Equality:

[ "$num1" -eq "$num2" ]: True if $num1 is equal to $num2.
Inequality:

[ "$num1" -ne "$num2" ]: True if $num1 is not equal to $num2.
Greater Than:

[ "$num1" -gt "$num2" ]: True if $num1 is greater than $num2.
Greater Than or Equal To:

[ "$num1" -ge "$num2" ]: True if $num1 is greater than or equal to $num2.
Less Than:

[ "$num1" -lt "$num2" ]: True if $num1 is less than $num2.
Less Than or Equal To:

[ "$num1" -le "$num2" ]: True if $num1 is less than or equal to $num2.
File Tests
File Exists:

[ -e "$file" ]: True if $file exists.
File is a Regular File:

[ -f "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is a regular file (not a directory or other type).
File is a Directory:

[ -d "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is a directory.
File is a Symbolic Link:

[ -L "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is a symbolic link.
File is Readable:

[ -r "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is readable.
File is Writable:

[ -w "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is writable.
File is Executable:

[ -x "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is executable.
File is Non-Empty:

[ -s "$file" ]: True if $file exists and is not empty.
Compound Expressions
AND Condition:

[ condition1 ] && [ condition2 ]: True if both condition1 and condition2 are true.
[[ condition1 && condition2 ]]: True if both condition1 and condition2 are true, using enhanced test syntax.
OR Condition:

[ condition1 ] || [ condition2 ]: True if either condition1 or condition2 is true.
[[ condition1 || condition2 ]]: True if either condition1 or condition2 is true, using enhanced test syntax.
NOT Condition:

[ ! condition ]: True if condition is false.
[[ ! condition ]]: True if condition is false, using enhanced test syntax.
