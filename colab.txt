Root Directory (/)
The root directory is the starting point of the Linux filesystem hierarchy. All other directories and files are placed under this directory.

Common Directories and Their Purposes
/bin

Contains essential binary executables (programs) necessary for the system to boot and run in single-user mode. Examples include common commands like ls, cp, mv, cat, and bash.
/boot

Contains the files necessary for the boot process, including the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk image (initrd or initramfs), and bootloader configuration files.
/dev

Contains device files that represent hardware devices and virtual devices. Examples include /dev/sda (a hard drive), /dev/null, and /dev/tty.
/etc

Contains system-wide configuration files and shell scripts used to boot and initialize system settings. Examples include /etc/passwd (user account information), /etc/fstab (filesystem mount points), and /etc/ssh/sshd_config.
/home

Contains the home directories for all user accounts on the system. Each user has a directory named after their username, e.g., /home/user.
/lib

Contains shared library files necessary for the binaries in /bin and /sbin. These libraries are similar to DLLs in Windows.
/media

Contains mount points for removable media such as USB drives, CDs, and DVDs. When you insert a USB drive, it might be automatically mounted to a subdirectory within /media.
/mnt

Used for temporarily mounting filesystems. System administrators might use this directory to manually mount a filesystem during maintenance.
/opt

Contains add-on application software packages. This directory is often used for software that is not managed by the system's package manager.
/proc

A virtual filesystem that contains information about system processes and hardware. Files within this directory are not real files but representations of system and process information. Examples include /proc/cpuinfo (CPU information) and /proc/meminfo (memory information).
/root

The home directory for the root user (the superuser).
/run

Contains runtime data for processes since the last boot. This directory is often used for process IDs, sockets, and other temporary files that are created at system startup.
/sbin

Contains essential system binaries used for system administration tasks. These binaries are typically used by the root user. Examples include fdisk, fsck, and ifconfig.
/srv

Contains data for services provided by the system. For example, web server files might be stored in /srv/www.
/sys

A virtual filesystem that provides information about devices, drivers, and some kernel features. It is used by the system to manage hardware and drivers.
/tmp

Contains temporary files created by system processes and users. This directory is often cleared at boot or on a regular schedule.
/usr

Contains user applications and files. It has several important subdirectories:
/usr/bin: Common user binaries.
/usr/sbin: System administration binaries.
/usr/lib: Libraries for binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
/usr/local: Binaries, libraries, and other files installed by the user or system administrator.
/var

Contains variable data files such as logs, databases, and caches. Subdirectories include:
/var/log: System log files.
/var/spool: Spool files for tasks like printing and mail.
/var/tmp: Temporary files that should persist between reboots.
